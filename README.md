# Machine Learning Workbench

A collection of lightweight wrappers for commonly used machine learning items, such as numpy arrays and Sklearn algorithms. Mostly as a way for me to keep various machine learning projects homogeneous and less ad-hoc.

## TODO

Add proper documentation, including examples.
